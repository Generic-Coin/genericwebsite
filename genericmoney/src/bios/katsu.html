Meet Katsu Mori, our exceptionally talented Web Developer here at Generic Coin. At 31, Katsu is a brilliant fusion of creativity and technical mastery, bringing a fresh and innovative perspective to our digital landscape.

Hailing from Japan, Katsu came to the United States as a foreign exchange student at the age of 17. His relentless curiosity and thirst for knowledge led him to pursue a degree in Information Technology. However, Katsu's creative spirit had other plans. He soon ventured into the realm of design, which ultimately sparked his passion for developing sleek, interactive, and visually arresting websites.

Since those early college years, Katsu has been sharpening his skills, becoming an integral part of our team. His professional journey took an exciting turn when he crossed paths with James, the founder of Generic Coin. Their close-knit friendship and shared entrepreneurial spirit make them an unstoppable force, constantly pushing boundaries in the digital currency industry.

When Katsu isn't painting pixels or crafting code, he enjoys spending quality time with Buck, his golden retriever, often taking him for long, relaxing walks. As a fervent foodie and sociable soul, Katsu loves exploring new eateries during the weekends, often bringing together his friends for a good catch-up over diverse and delectable meals.

Katsu's commitment to creativity extends far beyond his web designs. His innovative ideas and out-of-the-box thinking continually fuel our progress at Generic Coin, pushing us towards new horizons of growth and success.

Here's to Katsu Mori, the mastermind behind our digital presence, the code whisperer, and a passionate food explorer. His dedication, skill, and creativity are invaluable to us, and we couldn't be happier to have him on our team.
