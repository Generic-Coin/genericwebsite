yarn

github is annoying and does not accept multiple package.json files within a project, once you've run the above yarn command successfully, you can copy the contents of package.json to package-githubhatesmultiplepackagefiles.json and delete package.json to save yourself from having to move or rename the top level package.json any time you want to push changes 

cd genericmoney

yarn

yarn web

expo build:web
